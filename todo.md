# Install development goodies

- make better documentation on the plasma install script
- make SDDM theme work on boot
- theme GRUB
- make installation nicer

# Wallpapers

maybe publish as separate repo/AUR package.

make default screen user my wallpapers with slideshow configured.
that may require creating a new plasma theme, which is all good to me. :)
